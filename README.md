# Xblog

[中文 README ](README_zh.md)|[ Docs ](https://lufficc.com/blog/how-to-install-my-blog)

This blog is for my own use. I used to use hexo and github pages as my blog, but it's not flexible. Thus I write this
blog. What I want to say is laravel is the best php framework I've ever seen.

Later I will share some experience of writing this blog, welcome your watch.

If you find bugs , glad you to issue.
